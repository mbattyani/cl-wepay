cl-wepay
========

A Common Lisp client interface to the WePay Payments API.
See https://www.wepay.com/ for more details.

The client interface functions have been auto-generated from the API documentation pages on the WePay web site.
See wepay.lisp for that and to re-generate the functions if needed. The auto-generated API functions
are in wepay-api.lisp.
